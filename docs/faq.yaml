  q: I want to implement a single-page-app (SPA). Can i do that with kratos?
  a: Yes, definitely. We don't have an example-app, though. Also you might not come
    around some page-reloads as you definitely should avoid the API-flows and use
    the browser-flows instead. So hopefully you're not too strict with your SPA.

  - traits
  q: I want read-only or hidden user-specific data. Can't i use traits for that?
  a: Traits are currently visible to the user and also editable by him. Although it
    make sense to have read-only and/or hidden traits for users, we can't give any
    timing when such features will be available.

  q: How do I append a random suffix (e.g. a number) to OIDC usernames if the username
    returned by a provider is already taken?
  a: Not sure if jsonnet has a rand function built into the stdlib, but it does have
    the md5 function. You can probably use that

  q: Some of our identity traits fields may be the subject to identity validation
    (know your customer, KYC). Once they are validated we do not allow the identity
    to be edited by the end-user. Is there anything in the roadmap to support this
    scenario?
  a: As the extension of the previous point - the ability to freeze certain identity
    fields after registration.
