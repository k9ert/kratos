#kratos #spa <br/>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: I want to implement a single-page-app (SPA). Can i do that with kratos?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Yes, definitely. We don't have an example-app, though. Also you might not come around some page-reloads as you definitely should avoid the API-flows and use the browser-flows instead. So hopefully you're not too strict with your SPA.</p>

#kratos #admin #sessions #self-service <br/>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: I checked api spec, but found only two methods for session management. Can i list all sessions for identity? Does identity/admin can revoke session by id?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: see <a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/discussions/924">#924</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/655">#655</a> where these Feature being worked on</p>

#kratos #traits <br/>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: I want read-only or hidden user-specific data. Can't i use traits for that?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Traits are currently visible to the user and also editable by him. Although it make sense to have read-only and/or hidden traits for users, we can't give any timing when such features will be available.</p>

#kratos #oidc <br/>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: How do I append a random suffix (e.g. a number) to OIDC usernames if the username returned by a provider is already taken?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Not sure if jsonnet has a rand function built into the stdlib, but it does have the md5 function. You can probably use that</p>

#kratos #traits #kyc <br/>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Some of our identity traits fields may be the subject to identity validation (know your customer, KYC). Once they are validated we do not allow the identity to be edited by the end-user. Is there anything in the roadmap to support this scenario?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: As the extension of the previous point - the ability to freeze certain identity fields after registration.</p>
